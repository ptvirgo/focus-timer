## Installation

1. Install pre-requisite libraries for [haskell-gi](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi#installation)
2. From the base dir of this repo ...
    - Fresh: `$ cabal install focus-timer`
    - Typical rebuild: `$ cabal install focus-timer --installdir=$HOME/.local/bin/ --overwrite-policy=always` 

You'll have to run the executable more or less directly.
